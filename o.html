<h1 id="p">Blood group O </h1>
<p id="p">
(or blood group zero in some countries) individuals do not have either A or B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, and their blood serum contains IgM anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Therefore, a group O individual can receive blood only from a group O individual, but can donate blood to individuals of any ABO blood group (i.e., A, B, O or AB). If a patient in a hospital situation needs a blood transfusion in an emergency, and if the time taken to process the recipient's blood would cause a detrimental delay, O negative blood can be issued. Because it is compatible with anyone, O negative blood is often overused and consequently is always in short supply.According to the American Association of Blood Banks and the British Chief Medical Officer’s National Blood Transfusion Committee, the use of group O RhD negative red cells should be restricted to persons with O negative blood, women who might be pregnant, and emergency cases in which blood-group testing is genuinely impracticable.</p>
 <h3 id="p">  O Positive</h3>
 <p id="p">
As an O Positive donor you are incredibly important to maintaining the blood supply in our community. O Positive is the most common blood type and therefore needed by so many patients.
Annually, more than 120,000 units of blood, platelets and plasma are required to meet the needs of the hospitals we serve, and your blood type is crucial to maintaining an adequate supply. We are grateful to you for so willingly giving the “gift of life”, and through your continued commitment, we are able to maintain our heritage of service to those in need. 1 in 3 people have O+ blood (approximately 37.4% of the population).

<h3 id="p"> O Negative</h3>
<p id="p">
As an O Negative blood donor you have a particularly unique opportunity to help people in emergency situations. O Negative blood cells are called “universal” meaning they can be transfused to almost any patient in need, and only 6.6% of the population has O Negative blood. In the event of an emergency, trauma patients and accident victims are given a fighting chance at life due to O Negative blood transfusion. You may hear that “O Negative blood is the type they carry on the medical helicopters”. This is often the case when there is no time to ask questions.
Additionally, O Negative red blood cells are safest for newborn infants with under-developed immune systems. Your commitment to regular and frequent donations is especially important to maintain sufficient supplies for our community. And, local patients are grateful for your “gift of life”. It is also important to remember that while donors of all blood types can receive O Negative blood, those with O Negative blood can generally only receive O Negative blood. In extreme emergencies when O Negative is in short supply, sometimes O Positive can be substituted. 1 in 15 people have O- blood (approximately 6.6% of the population).
