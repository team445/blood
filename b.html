<h1 id="p">Blood group B </h1>
<p id="p">
 individuals have the B antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the A antigen. Therefore, a group B individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups B or O (with B being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals with type B or AB. </p>
 <h3 id="p">  B Positive</h3>
 <p id="p">
As a B Positive donor, you are very important to maintaining the blood supply in our community. B+ is the third most common occurring blood type. Your regular and frequent blood donations are especially valued, and many in our area will be given a fighting chance at life because of your generous gift. Annually, more than 120,000 units of blood, platelets and plasma are required to meet the needs of the hospitals we serve, and your blood type is crucial to maintaining an adequate supply.  We are grateful to you for so willingly giving the “gift of life”, and through your continued commitment, we are able to maintain our heritage of service to those in need. 1 in 12 people have B+ blood (approximately 8.5% of the population).</p>
<h3 id="p"> B Negative</h3>
<p id="p">
As a B Negative blood donor, you are unique due to the rarity of your blood. Because your blood is rare, it is important to maintain sufficient supplies for our community and local patients. In fact, only 1 in 67 people have B- blood (approximately 1.5% of the population).
Your regular and frequent blood donations are especially valued, and many in our area will be given a fighting chance at life because of your generous gift.
